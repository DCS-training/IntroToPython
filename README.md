# Introduction To Python 2023
Welcome to the repository for the introduction to python course with the CDCS. A repository can be thought of as a folder that has all the files you need in - the difference from a usual folder is that it is hosted online!

In this course you will be taking your first steps in learning how to programe in Python. The great thing is that this course is made to start from scratch. Therefore across the 3 sessions you'll be learning lots of different bits of terminology and bits about programming without the thought that you may have heard about it before. 

It is really key that throughout the course you ask questions whenever you are unsure about something. Both Sarah and Chris will be on hand at all points in the sessions and through the Teams channel to ensure you can ask whatever comes to your mind.
